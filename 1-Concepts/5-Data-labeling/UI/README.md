## Labeling data - object identification

1. For object identification a bounding box tool will be made available like below:

2. First indicate the tag, followed by clicking the second icon on the left, lastly drag the box around to object (the bounding box).

3. You have the following additional options: 

- Use the first icon on the left for region maniupulation. Drag the corners or edges to the preferred shape.

- Use the third icon on the left pane for multiplying bounding boxes of the same size.
