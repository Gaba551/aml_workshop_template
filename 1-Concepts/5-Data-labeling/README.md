# Data labeling

Azure Machine Learning also offers a data labeling capability to label large amounts of data in a fast and easy manner. It currently supports image classification (both multi-label and class) and object identification with bounded boxes.

When finished it can be exported in COCO format or as a dataset within Azure Machine Learning.

When using the Enterprise edition of Azure Machine Learning, ML assisted labeling can also be applied, which allows for automatic machine learning model triggering to accelerate the labeling task.
